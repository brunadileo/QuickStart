            <p>

              [Technica’s] Partner Program (the “Program”). We have
              designed the Program specifically with you and our
              customers in mind – i.e., to recognize and reward you for
              your “extra-mile” efforts in helping to drive our business
              and make our customers successful. Note that we will work
              to continuously improve and tailor the Program to best:

          <lightning-accordion-section name="B"
            label="2. With respect to the incentives we’re being invited to participate in, what is the difference between Promotions and Challenges?">
            <p>
              Promotions are transaction-based incentives – you get
              rewarded (in the form of a rebate) for each transaction.
            </p>

            <p>
              Challenges are performance-based incentives – you get
              rewarded (in the form of additional rebate) for the total
              number of activities or transactions you do over the
              Challenge time period.
            </p>

          <lightning-accordion-section name="C"
            label="3. How do I get more information on the incentives we’re being invited to participate in?">
            <p>

          <lightning-accordion-section name="d"
            label="4. Are rebates calculated according to the total deal value?">

          <lightning-accordion-section name="f"
            label="6. When will we receive our rebate payments?">
            <p>
              For transaction-based incentives, we will calculate the
              total rebate amount at the end of each quarter. You will
              receive your rebate payment approximately 45 days following
              the end of the quarter.
            </p>

            <p>
              For performance-based incentives (i.e., based on meeting a
              goal over a time period), you will receive your rebate
              payment approximately 45 days following the end of the
              incentive time period.

              to speak to your competence. As an individual, you can also
